# Java 8 features.
	Lambda expressions: Java 8 introduces lambda expressions, which allow developers to write more concise and readable code. Lambda expressions are anonymous functions that can be passed around like values and used to represent code blocks.

	Stream API: Java 8 also introduced the Stream API, which provides a functional programming-style approach to processing collections of data. Streams can be used to filter, map, and reduce data, making it easier to work with large data sets.

	Date and Time API: Java 8 introduces a new Date and Time API, which provides a more comprehensive and flexible way to work with dates and times. The new API includes classes such as LocalDate, LocalTime, and ZonedDateTime, which are designed to handle time zones and daylight saving time changes.

	Default methods: Java 8 introduces the concept of default methods, which allow interfaces to have concrete implementations for their methods. This feature makes it easier to add new functionality to existing interfaces without breaking backward compatibility.

	Optional class: Java 8 introduces the Optional class, which is designed to handle null values in a more concise and safe way. The Optional class provides a set of methods for checking whether a value is present, getting the value if it is present, or returning a default value if it is not present.

	Functional interfaces: Java 8 introduces the concept of functional interfaces, which are interfaces that have a single abstract method. Functional interfaces can be used with lambda expressions to provide a more concise way to write code.

	Method references: Java 8 introduces method references, which provide a way to refer to methods or constructors without actually invoking them. Method references can be used with lambda expressions to provide a more concise and readable syntax.

	Parallel arrays: Java 8 introduces parallel arrays, which are arrays that can be processed in parallel using the new Stream API. Parallel arrays can provide a significant performance improvement when working with large data sets.

	These are some of the key features of Java 8. Other enhancements include improved annotations, enhanced security, and better support for JavaScript and other scripting languages.
